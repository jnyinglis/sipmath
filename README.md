# SIPmath

Implement SIPmath functionality.

Step 1 is to implement streaming distributions.

I am taking inspiration (stealing) from Dave Thomas' Pollution project for streaming and factories.

To get a better understanding of SIPmath check out the Probability Management website at http://probabilitymanagement.org.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:sipmath, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```
